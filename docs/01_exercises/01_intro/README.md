## Task 01.03 - Motivation

Think about it why you want to learn creative coding. What would you like to achieve with it? What could be an interesting final project for you? 

Bullet points as answer are sufficient but please use whole sentences.

1. Draw the following house by *combining* shapes. 
2. Draw the same house with `beginShape` and `endShape`.

3. Draw a smiley with simple shapes.   
For this task, you will need to have a look at [arcs](../../02_scripts/ccfb_ss25_03_drawing_script.md#arc).

4. Draw a creative image with simple shapes. 

### Inspiration

You creative image can really be anything.  

In the context of creative coding and putting coding in an artistic context, you could try to think about carefully constructing a [visual design](https://editor.p5js.org/legie/sketches/cikqyBxbd). In my experience the visual quality is seldomly connected to the coding skills. Make use of what you have!

Some inspirations from classical artists:
