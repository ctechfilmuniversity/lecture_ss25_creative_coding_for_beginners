This course offers a basic introduction to programming with focus on graphics, sound and interaction. The programming framework is p5. Students gain fundamental programming skills and reflect on the usage of software in a creative context.


## Learning Objectives

With this course, you will gain

* an understanding of programming,
* **skills to develop simple programs from scratch**,
    * Knowledge about resources
    * Guidance towards and learning through self-studies,
* skills to apply programming as (an expressive) tool.

## Topics

Class topics can be divided into what you learn about programming itself and its *syntax* and what you do with your newly developed programming skill, meaning its application.

In regard to programming itself, we will cover:

* Commands, variables
* Events
* Conditions
* Loops
* Arrays
* Functions
* Maybe: Objects and Classes

We apply these programming skills to implement:

* Drawing, colors
* Interaction
* Movement / Animation
* Image, video
* Sound
  

Please note that topics are subject to change during the course!

## Materials

All materials are published on the [course website](https://ctechfilmuniversity.github.io/lecture_ss25_creative_coding_for_beginners/). Each morning the material for that day is uploaded.

### Coding

All coding is done in with the [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/). Please sign up for an account.

### Homework

To hand in your homework assignment, you submit links to your sketches in your OwnCloud document:

* [The OwnCloud Folder](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/Vj3IQ39a5f4llPD), PW: coding
* Open your file, add your text, links, etc.
  






## Policies

* **Plagiarism**: in programming and in times of AI-tools, the concept of plagiarism is relatively elusive. We are working with open-source tools and libraries, building upon the work of a multitude of people. You are encouraged and expected to tap into resources available online, and to copy-paste and tweak code you may not fully understand. However, it is categorically forbidden to outsource work to people outside the course or copy & paste, meaning plagiarize, assignments as a whole from others. 
* **Tools and utilities**: In general, you are allowed to use any tools you want, also AI-tools, but you are required to list and briefly describe the usage of such tools in your submission. However, in this class, I recommend that you follow my guidance on when to employ the help of an AI-tool and when not. Please, always make sure to utilize such tools for supporting your learning! 
* **Absences**: you are responsible for what happens in class whether you are here or not. I do not repeat content for you that you have missed because you were not in class.
* **Participation**: you are invited, encouraged, and expected to engage actively in discussion, reflection and activities. Also, you can exist for a few hours without chatting, texting or emailing on your computer and cellphone. I notice it and perceive it as quite rude if you don't pay attention, and I prefer that you only come to class if you are actually participating. 
* **Recording**: There are no recordings of the classes. No student may record any classroom activity without consent from me. If you have a disability such that you think you need to record classroom activities, get in touch with me.

## Inclusivity Statement

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives are served by this course, and that the diversity that students bring to this class is viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.  

It is my intent to present activities that accommodate and value a diversity of gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. I gladly honor your request to address you by your preferred name and gender pronoun. I commit to make individual arrangements to address disabilities or religious needs (e.g. religious events in conflict with class meetings and deadlines). Please advise me of these preferences and needs early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my plans and records.  

Debate and free exchange of ideas is encouraged, but I do not tolerate harassment, i.e. a pattern of behavior directed against a particular individual with the intent of humiliating or intimidating.

## Stress Culture

This class is demanding as I want you to further your skills, thinking and views of the world. This is hard. Also, as we are an interdisciplinary group, there is probably someone who you think is doing a much better job than you. Please focus on your own journey and trust the process.
  
Nevertheless, take care of yourself. All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available at Filmuni, and an important part of the university experience is learning how to ask for help. If you or anyone you know experiences any unbearable academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek support. The Filmuni offers different [services and counseling](https://www.filmuniversitaet.de/en/university/counseling-services) for you.
