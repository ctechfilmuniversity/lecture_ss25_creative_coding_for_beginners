* You might think that for doing cool, e.g. visual stuff with coding you need mountains of coding knowledge. That is not true. Even a with a beginners skill level you can do nice things.

Look for example at these different possibilities to do visual designs and even art with just an arrangement of circles!

???

  

* Class topics can be divided into what you learn about programming itself and its *syntax* and what you do with your newly developed programming skill, meaning its application.
  
We apply these programming skills to implement:
