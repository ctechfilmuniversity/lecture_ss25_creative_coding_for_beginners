.task[COMMENT:]  

* You might think that for doing cool, e.g. visual stuff with coding you need mountains of coding knowledge. That is not true. Even a with a beginners skill level you can do nice things.

Look for example at these different possibilities to do visual designs and even art with just an arrangement of circles!
